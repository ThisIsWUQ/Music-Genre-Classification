# Music-Genre-Classification
This notebook is part of my final project for course Introduction to Machine Learning

In this group project, here are my contributions:

Worked in a team in creating supervised models, Random Forest and XGBoost, for classifying music genres based on audio features using Python and relevant libraries i.e. NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-learn

Investigated the modelâ€™s problems; designed testing cases; tested, evaluated and compared possible models using Confusion Matrices, Learning Curves, F1-Score; fine-tuned the model until obtained the most satisfactory one; reported the findings
